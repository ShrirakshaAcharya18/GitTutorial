Hello Chapter 2

git init -> creates a new Git repository. Executing this command will create a new .git subdirectory in your current working
directory. This will also create a new main branch.

dir /a:h -> show all hidden files

C:/Users/raksh/OneDrive/Desktop/GitTutorial/.git -> creates an empty git repo in GitTutorial directory

Staging - In order to start tracking the changes in a file, it has to be added to the
staging area. It is a intermediate place where you can pick and choose which files
inside your working directory that you want to commit.

To see what's inside staging area: git status. Untracked file is shown in red.

git status -> shows the files that are not staged yet

git add -> adding files to staging area
git add . -> everything inside current dir

git status -> now the files will be green(after git add)

git commit -m "Completed chapter1" -> -m flag to add a commit message.

commit cmd helps to track of what changes have been made in each commit.
